        "content": "Although possess'd of youth and health,\nLet not vain thoughts abound,\nMidst every flower, as by stealth,\nInsects will oft be found.\nRemember then—remember when\nAll things in time will fail,\n\nCoolly survey the future, then\nRegard this earth as frail.\nAges have proved this saying true,\nNor can it be denied,\nDespite of all that men can do,\nEvil will flow from pride;\nLet meekness guide your course through life,\nLove, virtue, truth, and grace.\n\nCalmly avoid all needless strife,\nLeading you to disgrace,\nAlmira—this I bid you do,\nRespect yourself, the right pursue;\nKeep this advice always in view.",
