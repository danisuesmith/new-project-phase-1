# Book Search

The reason I made this project is because I am always looking for a change to be inspired by something new that I have read. Poetry is unique and much less time is needed to read a full poem. As someone who wants to find more time to read, I thought this would be a perfect oppurtunity to create something that does just that. The "Poem a Day" App is for anyone looking to discover something new and get in some reading that only requires a short amount of time. 

Initial Idea: App where people can go to discover different poets and their works. 

Features:

- Random "Poem of the Day" link
- Can favorite random poems
- Favorited poems will display under "poem list"
- Can click app name and will be taken to home page
